# tic-tac-toe_RL
A full-stack project that combines web development and machine learning to create an interactive Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent that learns using Q-learning.

	•	Interactive Gameplay: A smooth and responsive game interface built with React.
	•	User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT.
	•	Reinforcement Learning AI: A Python Q-learning agent that trains via self-play to learn optimal strategies.
	•	Full-Stack Integration: Seamless communication between the React front-end, Node.js back-end, and Python RL module

# Tech stack

	•	React & React Hooks: For building and managing a dynamic user interface.
	•	Node.js: Serving as the back-end to handle game logic and authentication.
	•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Providing secure authentication.
	•	Python & Q-Learning: Implementing the reinforcement learning algorithm for the AI agent.
